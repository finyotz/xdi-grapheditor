                    <section>
                        <p>The XDI Graph Editor is a visualization tool that facilitates exploring and editing XDI graphs. It can visualize the XDI graph with circles and lines to represent its nodes and links. In this documents, we refer to node and link as <b>element</b> in general.</p>

                            <b>Step 1</b> - Creating a minimal graph by importing an XDI statement
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    To do so, click on <b>File</b> and then <b>Import XDI</b> button and enter the following line:
                                    <code>[=]!:uuid:1111/$is$ref/=alice</code>
                                </li>
                                <li>Click the <b>Graph It</b> button and you will see a graph with 4 nodes and 4 links.</li>
                                <li>Some things worth noting on the generated graph:

                                        <li>The dashed red line is a relational statement. The grey ones are contextual statements.</li>
                                        <li>Edges are labeled in lightgray while nodes are labeled in black.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li><i>Note that you may enter many XDI single display line statements at once.</i>
